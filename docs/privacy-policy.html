<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 Mediclog stores personal information, which you have entered, or possibly
 collected via another app.
<p>
 This data is stored within the private storage used by the MedicLog app,
 until you decide to Send it via some other app to some destination of your
 choice. 
<h2>What type of information is collected ?</h2>
The app collects the information you enter, normally blood pressure, temperature and weight, plus the date and time, and
this is stored in the format described in <a href="https://github.com/JohnLines/mediclog/wiki/Data-format">
Data Format</a> on the documentation
for the app.

<h2>Who has access to your information ?</h2>
Nobody has access to your information, unless you send it to them,
by means of the <b>Send</b> button. The Send button passes the data to another app on your device, for example a mail app, such as K9mail or Gmail.
The default recipient and subject line can be saved in Preferences, but the app you pass the data to may allow these to be changed.
<p>
You should only pass your data to an app you trust, and which is sending it to a recipient you trust.

<h2>Can I delete my data</h2>
The Delete button will delete your data on the private storage used by the Mediclog app.

<hr>
This policy is also displayed by the MedicLog app when first run,
and can be shown again by selecting the <b>Display Privacy Policy on startup</b>
item in Preferences.
